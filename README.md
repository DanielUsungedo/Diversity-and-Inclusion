<h1>Diversity & Inclusion Dataset</h1>

 ### [Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMGYyZmNkYWItYTA0Ni00YjQyLThiNzMtNmIxMmYyN2VjZmU1IiwidCI6ImVjNGUyZDg4LTI3ODgtNGQ5Yi1hMjE0LTcyZGRhZDU4OGVkNyJ9)

<h2>Description</h2>
To succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world, businesses require a workforce with diverse talents and backgrounds. Diversity and inclusion, in my opinion, are business imperatives, not nice-to-haves. People and teams must feel welcomed and valued. This analysis aims to improve gender balance at the organization's executive level. This analysis included key performance indicators for <b>hiring</b> , <b>promotion</b> , <b>turnover</b> , and <b>performance </b> . 
I employed the use of Microsoft SQL in calculating the following metrics 

 • # of men
 
 • # of women
 
 • # of leavers
 
 • % employees promoted (FY21)
 
 • % of women promoted
 
 • % of hires men
 
 • % of hires women
 
 • % turnover 
 
 • Average performance rating: men
 
 • Average Performance rating: women

From the Analysis, the % of women promoted at the top managerial levels is drastically low. I discovered that it was related to

. % of Hires across all levels except Junior level favored men more than women.

. % of Women that left the organization the previous year was higher than that of the Men

My recommendations are to balance the hiring and promotion percentages for both genders across all levels of the organization, particularly top management positions.

Conduct extensive research into why women leave the organization at a much higher rate than men.
